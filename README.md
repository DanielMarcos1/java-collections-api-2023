## Getting Started

Welcome to the Collections API, on this project, I'll be solving a few exercises to practice OOP and Collections in general.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following structure:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - `OperacoesBasicas`: A package that contains a list of tasks (basically an exercise).
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
